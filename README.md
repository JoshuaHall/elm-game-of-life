# elm-game-of-life

Conway's Game of Life implemented with the Elm programming language

## Try it out locally

This requires two things:

- Elm
- Sass

Then, run `./optimize.sh src/Main.elm` in your terminal, and it will build the Elm and Sass code.

Finally, open up `index.html` and you should see the game :)
